# Policies
A collection of software development policies

## Purpose
[Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy) is the set of guiding principals that support a
development organization reach its goals.

## Procedures
Every policy must be documented in a single, well-known location, such as a wiki.  Policy and
procedures must be updated as organizational goals change.

## Discussion
Policies are distinct from procedures.  A policy states an organizational goal.  Procedures are the
processes an organization puts in place to enforce the policies are followed.
Policies are the 'what', procedures are the 'how'.

Every certification program, including ISO, requires that an organization document their policies.
