# Publication Policy
Prior to publication or other disclosure of artifacts a review of the copyright and/or license terms
is required.  The review must determine potential liabilities and impairment of other artifacts' value.

## Purpose
Publication of artifacts may be in the organization's interest for several reasons.  These include:
 * Protect organization from potential future patent infringement.
 * Advance organizationâ€™s reputation.
 * Promote standards.
 * Take advantage of public maintenance and support.

## Procedures
- Artifact developed on organization time or with organization assets is owned by the organization.
- Organization assets or purchased services may not be used for personal projects.
- Employees are free to publish their own intellectual property in any way they see fit.  
- An artifact may be published with license if it is determined:
  * That artifact is not core to our business.
  * Publication does not cause liability to organization.  Liability includes harm to our reputation.
  * Publication does not compromise or impair organization trade secrets, patents, or trademarks.
